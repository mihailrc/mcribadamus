##The McRib Availability Prediction Engine

For centuries people have looked to the wisdom of Nostradamus in order to see into the future. In modern times few problems have vexed mankind more than when the McRib(tm) sandwich will be available. Now, thanks to the power of McRibadamus, they can know the fate of the value meal that they love so much.

# Requirements

In this exercise you will be creating an application that we attempt to predict the availability of the McRib based upon the price of Lean Hog Futures (Pork) listed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Lean Hog Futures are traded on the months of February, April, May, Jun, July, August, October, and December. By prepending the year to the appropriate symbol one can call Yahoo Finance in order to retrieve the current market prices.
