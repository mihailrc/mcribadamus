## The McRib Availability Prediction Engine

For centuries people have looked to the wisdom of Nostradamus in order to see into the future. In modern times few problems have vexed mankind more than when the McRib(tm) sandwich will be available. Now, thanks to the power of McRibadamus, they can know the fate of the value meal they love so much.

# Requirements

In this exercise you will be creating an application that we attempt to predict the availability of the McRib based upon the price of Lean Hog Futures (Pork) listed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Lean Hog Futures are traded on the months of February, April, May, Jun, July, August, October, and December. By prepending the year to the appropriate symbol one can call Yahoo Finance in order to retrieve the current market prices.

## Iteration 1 - Server Side Functionality

This iteration covers core functionality of grabbing the remote futures market data, and analyzing it to report on the likely hood that the McRib sandwich will be available during that period.

### Feature: Determine the next offerings

- Construct Yahoo! Finance JSON links

### Feature: Analyze Futures Market Data

> As a user I want to be able to take the latest CME futures data and report if the price is greater than the threshold I have determined to be needed in order for the McRib to be available.
